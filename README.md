# WebGL

You can try the WebGL build, but there are a couble things that are different/Don't work. 
1. Main Menu and Game Over menu skybox doesnt render.
2. Game Logo goes to the side in full screen.
3. Sound can go a little funky.

I'm not gonna fix this, since it's more for trying the game without going to the arcade machine.
