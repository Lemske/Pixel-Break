1. Roll a Ball
   This was made a intro to the GMD course. It was a simple game to get the hang of Unity and C#. It was mainly to learn how to insert things into a scene, the concept of prefabs, and how to use the physics engine in Unity. Other than that, I also implemented a few other assignments into roll a ball, tried particle system, and a clock. All in all it was a fine introduction to unity and its layout.
