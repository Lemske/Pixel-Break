# Block Post 3 - Game Loop

### Game Loop

This is all about making something that can be played. There are a good couple of things i still need to to before I can call quits so lets go over them one by one.

### Main Menu

First a main Menu would be nice...

### Texturing the ground

I would have loved to do the texturing of the ground myself, in the pixel stile this game is going for. But I have to focus on more important things, so I simply used a stock texture from adobe stock (https://stock.adobe.com/dk/search?k=pixel+grass).
If I end up having time, I'll go back and make my own texture. But for now this will do, and id rather have texture than not.
