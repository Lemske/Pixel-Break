# Game Design Document

## Where are they?

The Game Designs Documents will be saved over on the google drive. Every time i revisit it, I will make a new version of the document and give the link in this document.
This is primarily done so people don't have to jump between branches to see the changes in the document.

### Version 1 - The Initial Draft

This is the initial draft for the game. It mainly focuses on some of the mechanics and gameplay, trying not to look to far into the future.

### Version 2 - The Initial Draft++

Just added some things to the initial draft, and defined the 3 steps to get the simple game up and running.
